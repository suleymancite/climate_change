In this tutorial, we are creating a line plot of a temperature index. The graph reproduced is below.

Loading packages used in the tutorial

```{r}
#| echo: false

library(tidyverse)
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}

2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
